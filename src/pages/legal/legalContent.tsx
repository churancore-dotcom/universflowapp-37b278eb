    <h2>1. Who this applies to</h2>
    <p>These Artist Terms apply when you apply for, or hold, a verified Artist account on {COMPANY_DISPLAY}. The general User Terms also apply.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility & verification</h2>
    <p>You confirm that the identity document, photo and social links you submit belong to you and that you have the right to be promoted as the artist named in the application. Verification typically takes 1 to 3 days. We may approve or reject any application at our sole discretion.</p>

    <h2>3. Your content</h2>
    <p>You may publish only music you own or have full rights to distribute. By uploading a song you grant {COMPANY_DISPLAY} a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to stream the audio at the URL you provide and to display the title, artwork, lyrics excerpts and your artist profile inside the App.</p>

    <h2>4. URL-only publishing</h2>
    <p>You publish songs by providing a direct stream URL (your own website, CDN, label HLS, etc.). We do <strong>not</strong> accept YouTube, JioSaavn, Spotify, SoundCloud or other aggregator links — those will be rejected automatically. You are responsible for keeping the URL online; if it stops responding the song will appear unavailable.</p>

    <h2>5. No monetization (today)</h2>
    <p>The Artist programme is currently a promotion and discovery channel. We do <strong>not</strong> pay royalties, advances, or per-stream payouts at this time. If we add monetization in the future, separate terms will apply.</p>

    <h2>6. Removal & takedown</h2>
    <p>We may remove any song, take down your profile, or revoke your Verified badge if (a) we receive a credible copyright complaint, (b) the content violates the User Terms, or (c) the verification proofs you provided turn out to be false. You can delete your songs at any time from the Artist Studio.</p>

    <h2>7. Copyright complaints</h2>
    <p>To report infringement, email {SUPPORT_EMAIL} with the song URL and proof of ownership. We action valid complaints within 7 days.</p>

    <h2>8. No exclusivity</h2>
    <p>You stay free to publish your music anywhere else. We claim no exclusivity over your masters or recordings.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party may end the Artist relationship at any time. We can revoke artist status; you can request account deletion via {SUPPORT_EMAIL}.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>Artist support: {SUPPORT_EMAIL}.</p>

    <h2>1. What we collect from artists</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identity:</strong> full name, stage name, phone, country.</li>
      <li><strong>KYC documents:</strong> the government ID you choose (e.g. Voter ID, PAN, Passport, Driver's Licence) and a selfie. Used only to confirm you are the artist you claim to be.</li>
      <li><strong>Artist photo:</strong> kept as your public profile picture.</li>
      <li><strong>Public profile:</strong> stage name, bio, avatar, banner, social links — all visible on your artist page.</li>
      <li><strong>Stats:</strong> aggregated plays, likes, downloads and follower counts for your songs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Document retention — important</h2>
    <p>Your KYC documents (ID front/back and selfie) are stored in a private, owner-and-admin-only bucket and are <strong>automatically deleted</strong> the moment your application is approved or rejected. A daily safety job also hard-deletes any KYC file older than 7 days, no matter what.</p>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your ID for advertising, sell it, share it with brokers, or store it long-term. It exists only long enough for a human reviewer to confirm your identity.</p>

    <h2>3. Legal basis</h2>
    <p>We process KYC on the basis of your explicit consent at submission, and on our legitimate interest to prevent fraud and copyright abuse. You can withdraw consent at any time by deleting your application before review.</p>

    <h2>4. Your rights (GDPR + India DPDP Act)</h2>
    <p>You may access, correct, export, or delete your artist data at any time by writing to {SUPPORT_EMAIL}. We respond within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>5. Sharing</h2>
    <p>KYC files are visible only to {COMPANY_DISPLAY} reviewers. Your public profile (stage name, bio, photo, social links) is visible to every visitor and indexed by search engines.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>Files are stored encrypted at rest, transferred over HTTPS, and gated by per-user row-level security.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>Artist privacy questions: {SUPPORT_EMAIL}.</p>
